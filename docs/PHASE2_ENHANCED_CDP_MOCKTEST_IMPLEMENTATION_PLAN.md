```typescript
interface EnhancedQuestion {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswerIndex: number;
  explanation: {
    basic: string;           // Core concept explanation
    theory: string;          // Theoretical foundation
    realLifeExample: string; // Practical application
    detailed: string;        // Comprehensive breakdown
  };
  metadata: {
    subjectName: SubjectName;
    topicId: string;
    subTopicId: string;
    difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
    ncfReference: string;    // NCF 2005 alignment
    keywords: string[];      // For search/filtering
  };
}
```

#### Content Enhancement Strategy
- **Theory Section:** Link to NCF 2005 principles and educational psychology
- **Real-Life Examples:** Classroom scenarios, student case studies
- **Detailed Explanations:** Step-by-step reasoning and concept mapping
- **Visual Aids:** Integration points for diagrams and flowcharts

### 2. Advanced Mock Test System

#### Core Components
```typescript
interface MockTestConfig {
  subject: SubjectName;
  questionCount: number;
  difficulty: 'mixed' | 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  timeLimit?: number; // minutes
  topics?: string[]; // specific topics to include
}

interface TestResult {
  id: string;
  config: MockTestConfig;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  answers: number[];
  score: number;
  totalQuestions: number;
  timeSpent: number;
  questionBreakdown: QuestionResult[];
}

interface QuestionResult {
  questionId: string;
  selectedAnswer: number;
  correctAnswer: number;
  timeSpent: number;
  topic: string;
  difficulty: string;
}
```

#### Analytics Engine
```typescript
interface PerformanceAnalytics {
  overall: {
    successRate: number;
    averageTime: number;
    improvement: number; // % change from previous tests
  };
  bySubject: Record<SubjectName, SubjectAnalytics>;
  byTopic: Record<string, TopicAnalytics>;
  trends: {
    scoreProgression: number[];
    timeEfficiency: number[];
    weakAreas: string[];
  };
}

interface GapAnalysis {
  knowledgeGaps: {
    topic: string;
    currentProficiency: number;
    recommendedFocus: string[];
  }[];
  timeManagement: {
    averageTimePerQuestion: number;
    recommendedPace: number;
  };
  improvementAreas: string[];
}
```
